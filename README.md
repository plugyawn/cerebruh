# Platform Support

### Windows
Fully supported and tested. Updates will first come to Windows.

### MacOS
Absolutely not supported as of now. However, changing the hotkey for the copy function to correspond to MacOS should fix some issues.

# FAQs

### How do I run this?
Extract the .zip file to a directory of your choice and run ```cerebruh.py``` from the command-prompt.
Depending on how Python is configured on your system, this command might be ```py cerebruh.py``` once command-prompt is focused on the right directory.

### How do I install the libraries?
You'll need PIP. On Windows, if it hasn't been installed already with Python, ```python get-pip.py``` or ```py get-pip.py``` in the command-prompt could help.
Once PIP is installed, use ```pip install [libary]``` to install that library. You'll need to be connected to the internet.

### How do I use this program?
Once the program is running, highlight some text and press F2 to see how Urban Dictionary defines that word, or, press F9 to see how Wikipedia defines it. If you are on a laptop, some OEMs may require you to press the ```fn``` key along with F2 or F9.
